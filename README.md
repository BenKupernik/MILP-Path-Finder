The goal is to make a program that takes the output from flopyâ€™s GridIntersect.intersect function and makes a continuous path along the cell edges nearest to the Horizontal Flow Boundary (HFB). This is very similar to the Traveling Sailsman problem and can likely be solved in the same way. The plan is to create an undirected graph out of cells that the HFB crosses. Edges will have a distance coefficient based off how far the centroid of the line segment in that cell is from each edge. A decision function of the sum of all edges multiplied by their distance coefficients can then be created and minimized. Resulting in a list of edges that most closely follow the HFB.
